# 🚀 About Me

I'm a programmer with varying interests and aspiring embedded systems developer who's fascinated by the intersection of **low-level systems**, **graphics**, and **games**. My journey started with wanting to understand how games work, and now I'm a novice in C, building things that actually matter.

**Current Role:** Vice President @ Robotics Club | Coding Trainer

## 💻 What I'm Building

### :dart: Active Projects

🖼️ **Image-to-ASCII Engine** 
Converting images into ASCII art. In extension of creating a terminal game and not wanting to draw ASCII art

🛠️ **Intel 8080 Emulator**  
Emulating vintage CPU architecture from scratch. Understanding computers by rebuilding them, Creating emulator for group project in creaating an Arcade machine

### 🎮 The Master Plan

After finishing the i8080 emulator, I'm diving into:
- **Arduino emulators & simulators** — bringing embedded systems to software 
- **Portfolio website** — showcasing all this madness
- More emulators for retro hardware (because that's where the magic is)
  
## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

**Languages I Actually Use/Used:**
- **C** — where I live now (systems programming, emulators)
- **Python** — where it all started (scripting, automation)
- **C#** — Unity days (game dev experiments)

**Tools:**
- Git & GitHub
- VS Code 
- Debuggers (lots of them)
